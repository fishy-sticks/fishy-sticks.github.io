        Hi my name is Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way and I have long ebony black hair (that's how I got my name) <br>
        with purple streaks and red tips that reaches my mid-back and icy blue eyes like limpid tears and a lot of <br>
        people tell me I look like Amy Lee (AN: if u don't know who she is get da hell out of here!). I'm not related<br>
         to Gerard Way but I wish I was because he's a major fucking hottie. I'm a vampire but my teeth are straight <br>
         and white. I have pale white skin. I'm also a witch, and I go to a magic school called Hogwarts in England <br>
         where I'm in the seventh year (I'm seventeen). I'm a goth (in case you couldn't tell) and I wear mostly black. <br>
         I love Hot Topic and I buy all my clothes from there. For example today I was wearing a black corset with <br>
         matching lace around it and a black leather miniskirt, pink fishnets and black combat boots. I was wearing <br>
         black lipstick, white foundation, black eyeliner and red eye shadow..<br><br>
